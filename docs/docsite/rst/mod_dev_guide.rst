Community OpenWrt Module Developer Guide
========================================

If you are reading this, it is likely you are already an user of the collection and want to extend it:
Awesome! Everyone is welcome to contribute!
This collection is based on the Ansible role ``gekmihesg.openwrt`` and as such it does not require Python
installed on the OpenWrt devices - all the code is written in plain shell scripts.

There are skills that are going to help you immensely if you intend to work on Ansible modules for ``community.openwrt``:

* A fair understanding of how modules work in general. Having contributed with Python-based modules will definitely help you.
* A very good experience with shell scripts and all its idiosyncrasies.

Challenges
^^^^^^^^^^^

Using shell-based modules on the target instead of Python brings a few practical drawbacks that developers should keep in mind:

* The AnsiballZ framework, used to transfer the Python modules to the target destination, has limited support for shell scripts.
  In particular, if the module script uses ``source`` or ``.`` to include another file that does not exist in the target,
  that dependency is not recognized by Ansible and the dependency script is **not** transferred over.
  Therefore, there is no ``module_utils`` available to the shell module.

  * There is no Python standard library with all its functions, only the commands available in the router's shell.
  * There is no ``module_utils``, so all the convenience of the ``AnsibleModule`` class is not available.
    As a consequence, there is no consolidated mechanism to validate parameters or to
    `enforce dependencies between options <https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_program_flow_modules.html#dependencies-between-module-options>`_.

* Many sanity checks are useless for shell-scripts, for example the cross-checking of documented parameters and those declared in the code, as they do in Python.
* Debuggability is harder: stack traces and structured errors are not available; logs depend on ``set -x`` tracing and are noisy.
* Ansible unit tests are base in ``pytest`` and it is not trivial to run sophisticated shell-script tests in that scenario.
* Both unit and integration tests are impacted by the fact that this collection requires non-standard container images to run the tests.
* Testing is slower and narrower: meaningful coverage needs molecule/container. Cross-version verification (21.02/22.03/23.05/24.10) takes time.
* Security hardening is manual: input sanitization, temporary file handling, and permission fixes (see wrapper script) must be explicitly coded; Python's safer defaults and libraries are absent.

Most of these challenges have not been solved yet, some may never be. But they clearly show that there is a lot of room for improvements.


Runtime architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first thing to solve is to actually make it possible to run modules written as shell-scripts. Without that, there are no modules at all.
Ansible modules are programs that, when executed, read JSON content from their ``stdin`` and write back results (successful or otherwise) as
JSON content to their ``stdout`` file descriptor.

Handling ``stdin`` and ``stdout`` is not a problem for shell scripts, but there is no native mechanism to handle JSON content.
For this OpenWrt has a builtin utility named ``jshn`` (JSON SHell Notation) that can be used by shell scripts. See more about it below.

The next problem is: how to include a "standard shell library" in every script? The ``gekmihesg.openwrt`` role solved that by creating coding the
"standard library" in this ``wrapper.sh`` script and "monkeypatching" the default action plugin in Ansible, to _inject_ the module script
into the wrapper, upon use.

This collection takes a slightly different approach. Instead of patching Python code and shell code during runtime:

* ``wrapper.sh`` has been made into a module, meaning it was moved to the directory ``plugins/modules`` and, as a "module",
  it now reads JSON input, where it expects to find a parameter containing the name of a script.
  Instead of patching, it sources the module script, and then run some standard lifecycle functions from it.
* a reusable class ``OpenwrtActionBase`` derived from ``ActionBase`` was created (in ``plugins/plugin_utils``), and
  every single module in this collection **MUST** also implement a companion action plugin based on that class.
  That class overrides the ``run()`` method and implements an elegant solution:

    1. Find the module (shell-script) file on the control node
    2. Transfer that module to a temporary location on the target node (OpenWrt)
    3. Instead of executing the original named module, runs the wrapper module instead, passing the path
       of the temporary file as a proper Ansible parameter
    4. The wrapper executes, including the original module


Wrapper helper library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``wrapper.sh`` script exposes a compact library of functions and conventions that shell-based modules
must use to parse parameters, produce results, handle files, and implement idempotent behaviour.
The following sections group those helpers by functional domain and explain their intended use.

Lifecycle
""""""""""

Every shell module executed via the wrapper MUST implement the canonical lifecycle functions. The wrapper will invoke these functions in a strict sequence; modules must not rely on ad-hoc top-level execution.

  init()
      Perform setup, parameter validation and any checks that should prevent ``main`` from running. If ``init`` fails, exit non‑zero to stop execution.

  main()
      Implement the module's primary behaviour here.

  cleanup()
      Remove temporaries and perform finalization.

Example (module skeleton):

.. code-block:: sh

  PARAMS="name/s state/s"

  init() {
    [ "$state" != "present" -a "$state" != "absent" ] && fail "state must be one of: present, absent"
  }

  main() {
    # do work here
    changed
    json_add_string msg "ok"
  }

  cleanup() {
    # remove temporaries
    :
  }


Parameter parsing
""""""""""""""""""

Module parameters must be declared by setting the ``PARAMS`` variable.
It is a string, with a space-delimited list of parameters declared in a specific format::

  NAME[=ALIAS1[=ALIAS2[=...]]]/TYPE/[REQ]/DEFAULT

Example (from ``sysctl``):

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 50 50

  * - shell-based module
    - Python equivalent
  * - .. code-block:: sh

        PARAMS="
            ignore_errors=ignoreerrors/bool
            name=key/str/r
            reload/bool//true
            state/str//present
            sysctl_file/str
            sysctl_set/bool//false
            value=val/str
        "
    - .. code-block:: python

        argument_spec=dict(
            ignore_errors=dict(type="bool", aliases=["ignoreerrors"]),
            name=dict(type="str", required=True, aliases=["key"]),
            reload=dict(type="bool", default=True),
            state=dict(type="str", default="present"),
            sysctl_file=dict(type="str"),
            sysctl_set=dict(type="bool", default=False),
            value=dict(type="str", aliases=["val"]),
        ),

It is recommended that the ``PARAMS`` variable is set outside any function in the script.
The actual parsing happens by calling the shell function ``_parse_params()``, and the wrapper
automatically does that after the script is sourced. If you define it inside ``init()``,
then your code must make sure ``_parse_params()`` is called after ``PARAMS`` is defined.

.. note::

  The "type" field accepts the values and equivalences:

  * ``any``
  * ``s``, ``str``, ``string``
  * ``i``, ``int``, ``integer``
  * ``b``, ``bool``, ``boolean``
  * ``f``, ``d``, ``float``, ``double``
  * ``l``, ``a``, ``list``, ``array``
  * ``o``, ``h``, ``obj``, ``object``, ``hash``, ``map``

.. note::

  There is no support for specifying sub-options.

.. admonition:: TO-DO

  Write about ``FILE_PARAMS``


JSON helpers
"""""""""""""

As mentioned above, OpenWrt provides ``jshn`` to help parsing and generating JSON content.
Check `jshn <https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/jshn>`_ for more information on how
to use it.

When writing modules, you will not need to worry about parsing, and you do not need to use it for producing
return values when using the standard mechanism for generating result values (see below).
You will possibly want to use it to generate content is using the custom mechanism.
Regardless of that, it is a nice addition to the toolbox.

Example (use JSON helpers in ``main``):

.. code-block:: sh

  main() {
    json_set_namespace result
    json_init
    json_add_boolean changed 0
    json_add_string msg "All good"
    json_add_object ansible_facts
    json_add_string my_fact "value"
    json_close_object
    json_dump
  }

.. seealso::

  * `jshn.sh - Handling Nested Loops <https://medium.com/@bear_with_me/jshn-sh-handling-nested-loops-ebf1501d7aa7>`_
  * `jshn: shell library to work with JSON <https://github.com/stokito/jshn-jsonc/tree/master>`_ (GitHub repository for ``jshn``)


Result values construction
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Standard Mechanism
------------------

Similar to the ``PARAMS`` variable, the return values must be declared in the ``RESPONSE_VARS`` variable.
It should also be declared outside any function in the module, and its expected content is a string,
with a space-delimited list of return value names. The name correspond to shell variable names, and the actual
return value for each one of them is the value of the namesake variable itself.

Example:

.. code:: sh

  RESPONSE_VARS="name value"

This example will cause the script to return the values ``name`` and ``value`` containing, respectively,
the shell values ``$name`` and ``$value``.

.. caution::

  In shell scripts all variables are strings and there is no enforcing of the return types.

.. admonition:: TO-DO

  Write about ``FACT_VARS``

Custom Mechanism
-----------------

If you want to have fine-grained control of the output, you can add:

.. code:: sh

  NO_EXIT_JSON=1

To your script, and it will refrain from generating the JSON output automatically.
In that case, the module is responsible for writing the output JSON content to ``stdout``.

See the file ``plugins/modules/setup.sh`` for an example of that mechanism.

Additional constructs
----------------------

The wrapper script also provides some convenience constructs that affect the outcome and the exit flow
of the module.

  changed
      Command receives no parameter. Once called, the module will register ``changed=true`` in its output.

  fail
      Command arguments are made into a string that becomes the return value ``msg``,
      and the module returns a non-zero exit code indicating failure.

  try
      Command will attempt to execute its arguments as a command in itself, and it invokes ``fail`` if the
      command is not successful. Example (from ``copy``):

      .. code:: sh

        try mkdir "$p"

      If the ``mkdir`` command fails, then the entire module fails.

  final
      Similar to ``try``, but if the command is successful, then the module exits indicating success.


File, checksum and base64 utilities
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. admonition:: TO-DO

  To be done.

.. Common file and checksum tasks are implemented as helpers so modules can be idempotent:

.. - ``_get_file_attributes`` / ``set_file_attributes``: gather permission/owner/mode information and apply changes; ``set_file_attributes`` respects check mode and marks ``changed`` when differences are applied.
.. - ``backup_local``: create a timestamped local copy of a file before overwriting it.
.. - ``dgst`` / ``md5``: compute checksums using available system utilities (falls back to openssl when possible); used by modules that need checksum verification.
.. - ``base64``: wrapper to perform Base64 encoding with available utilities or fallbacks.

.. Example (backup, checksum and install in `main`):

.. .. code-block:: sh

..   main() {
..     old_backup=$(backup_local /etc/config/foo) || true
..     checksum_before=$(md5 /etc/config/foo 2>/dev/null || echo "")
..     # write new content to temp
..     printf '%s' "$new_content" > /tmp/foo.new
..     checksum_after=$(md5 /tmp/foo.new)
..     if [ "$checksum_before" != "$checksum_after" ]; then
..       mv /tmp/foo.new /etc/config/foo || fail "install failed"
..       changed
..     fi
..   }

Pathname helpers
"""""""""""""""""

Utilities to work reliably with paths and symlinks:

  is_abs()
      Test whether a path is absolute.

  abspath()
      Compute an absolute path for a given file (with optional ``-P`` semantics for physical resolution).

  realpath()
      Resolve symlinks to return the canonical path. These helpers make scripts more robust when moving files or resolving included filenames.

Example:

.. code-block:: sh

  main() {
      src="./relative/path"
      abs_src=$(abspath "$src")
      real_src=$(realpath "$abs_src")
      cp "$real_src" /tmp/ || fail "copy failed"
      changed
  }

Diff and change detection
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. admonition:: TO-DO

  To be done.


.. The wrapper provides a small diff helper set used by modules that implement textual changes:

.. - ``set_diff``: record ``before`` and ``after`` string values and optional headers; when present, the wrapper includes a ``diff`` object in the final JSON output.
.. - Modules that produce diffs must populate the corresponding ``_diff_before`` and ``_diff_after`` values (or call ``set_diff``) so the final JSON contains useful before/after data for Ansible's reporting.

.. Example (set diff for a textual change inside `main`):

.. .. code-block:: sh

..   main() {
..     _ diff _ before="$(cat /etc/config/foo)"
..     _ diff _ after="${_diff_before/old/new}"
..     set_diff "$_diff_before" "$_diff_after" "before header" "after header"
..     changed
..   }

Check mode and idempotence support
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Modules that support check mode must set the variable:

.. code:: sh

  SUPPORTS_CHECK_MODE=1

Otherwise, the module will automatically bail out if executed in check mode.

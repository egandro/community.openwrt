Community OpenWrt How-To Guide
==============================

Welcome to the Community OpenWrt How-To Guide! This is a collection of recipes that will help you
using the ``community.openwrt`` role in real world scenarios.

Most OpenWrt devices have a very small footprint and there is no space available to install Python. Based on this constraint, virtually all of the standard Ansible modules are not available. 

It is a design rule of ``community.openwrt`` not to require Python, rather providing modules based on shell scripts (``/bin/sh``) instead.

Also by the nature of OpenWrt and its CLI-based ``uci`` tool, you need to be very familiar how
this ecosystem works. Even the creation of a Wifi passwort or a simple forwarding rule can
be challenging.

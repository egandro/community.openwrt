## Warning

While community.openwrt 1.0.0 is not released, there is no strong commitment to backward compatibility - breaking changes may be introduced without further notices.

We appreciate the feedback from users during this phase, but keep in mind that this collection is **not yet deemed ready for production** workloads.

## Description

This collection enables the automated configuration of your OpenWrt devices.

We encourage new users to read the [User Guide](https://ansible-collections.github.io/community.openwrt/branch/main/docsite/user_guide.html).

If you are migrating from the `gekmihesg.openwrt` role, please read the
[Migration Guide](https://ansible-collections.github.io/community.openwrt/branch/main/docsite/migration_guide.html).

Check the [complete documentation](https://ansible-collections.github.io/community.openwrt/branch/main/index.html) for the collection.
Please note that this documentation reflects the state of the development branch.

## Our mission

<!-- Put your collection's mission statement in here. Example follows. -->

At the `community.openwrt`, our mission is to produce and maintain simple, flexible,
and powerful open-source software tailored to manage and support [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) devices.

This Ansible collection is originally based on the role `gekmihesg.openwrt`, maintained by [Markus Weippert](https://github.com/gekmihesg) until 2022.
We acknowledge and we are grateful for the time and effort he dispensed to maintain that role over the years.

We welcome members from all skill levels to participate actively in our open, inclusive, and vibrant community.
Whether you are an expert or just beginning your journey with Ansible and `community.openwrt`,
you are encouraged to contribute, share insights, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts!

## Governance

<!--Describe how the collection is governed. Here can be the following text:-->

The process of decision making in this collection is based on discussing and finding consensus among participants. **Every voice is important**. If you have something on your mind, create an issue or dedicated discussion and let's discuss it!

## Tested with Ansible

<!-- List the versions of Ansible the collection has been tested with. Must match what is in galaxy.yml. -->

The collection is currently tested with `ansible-core` versions:

- 2.18
- 2.19
- 2.20
- devel

## External requirements

The collection is currently tested against OpenWrt versions:

- 23.05 ([EOL](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/openwrt-23-05-6-service-release/239506))
- 24.10
- 25.12-rc3

Keep in mind that OpenWrt
[supports only two or three different release numbers](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/security#support_status).
As defined in [Release and Maintenance](MAINTENANCE.md),
the collection supports at least one EOL version of OpenWrt.

### Testing Requirements

The test uses [Ansible Molecule](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/molecule/) to
spin up containers running OpenWrt (there are images available for the `x86_64` architecture).

Tests require:

- a container runtime (docker, podman, containerd, etc...)
- Python packages specified in [requirements-test.txt](./requirements-test.txt)

The tests are being performed using docker connections.
